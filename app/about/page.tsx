            I&apos;m Govind. I joined an early-stage startup as a 4th-year
            BTech intern and started shipping production code almost
            immediately. I came from a normal tier-3 college. I graduated with
            a gold medal, but I&apos;ve never thought of that as my real
            achievement.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">My actual growth started after I joined.</p>

            The path I didn&apos;t take
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">
            I&apos;m not the developer who spent years grinding interview
            questions. When I joined, I had basic programming knowledge and
            some full-stack fundamentals, but almost no production experience.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">
            The product wasn&apos;t mature. The company wasn&apos;t mature.
            The processes weren&apos;t mature. We were figuring things out
            while building — no perfect roadmap, no certainty about where the
            product would end up. We learned from users and evolved.
          </p>

            Learning during the AI era
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">
            I entered software during the rise of AI-assisted development. A
            lot of the early work involved tools like Gemini and Claude. But I
            never blindly accepted what they produced.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">
            I worked under engineers with more than a decade of experience who
            reviewed everything carefully. They rejected my PRs. They asked me
            why. They made me defend my choices.
          </p>
          <p className="pull text-[26px]">
            Many of my most valuable lessons came from things I first
            disagreed with — until months later a real need proved they
            mattered.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">
            Ex: extracting strings into constants. Design consistency. Writing
            tests. Naming conventions. Feature gating. I learned the value of
            each one long after I&apos;d argued against it.

          <h2 className="mb-4 mt-[38px] font-display text-[27px] font-medium tracking-[-0.5px]">
            What I actually learned
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-5 text-body">
            I learned software engineering by shipping, debugging,
            maintaining, and improving a real SaaS system. I learned from
            mentors. From mistakes. From customers. From testers. From
            production incidents. From building.
          </p>
          <p className="text-body">
            Good engineering optimises for the change you can&apos;t see
            coming, not just the task in front of you. That&apos;s the lesson
            under almost everything I write here.
