Any detail that didn't get written down was simply lost.",

Technicians, supervisors, and managers record shift handovers, track testing progress train by train, log pending activities, and post production updates in a consistent, structured format — so nothing falls through the gap between shifts, and management can read the state of the floor without asking anyone for a report.",
